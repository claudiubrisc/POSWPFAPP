# POSWPFAPP

**POSWPFAPP** is a simple Point of Sale (POS) application built with **C#** and **Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)**.
It demonstrates how to manage POS entities, handle XML serialization/deserialization, and build a lightweight WPF UI.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **WPF User Interface** for basic POS operations
- ✅ **Entity management** (products, services, etc.)
- ✅ **XML Serialization & Deserialization** examples
- ✅ Modular architecture with a separate **EntitatiPOS** library
- ✅ Precompiled executable (`POSAppWPF.exe`) for quick testing

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **.NET Framework / C#**
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**
- **XML Serialization** for data persistence
